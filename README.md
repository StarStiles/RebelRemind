# 🔔 Rebel Remind ⏰

**Rebel Remind** is a Google Chrome extension built to unify and simplify notifications for students at the **University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV)**.

### 🎯 The Problem

UNLV students receive updates from a maze of sources — **Canvas**, **Rebel News**, the **Involvement Center**, and **Campus Alerts**. Important deadlines and announcements often get buried in email overload or missed entirely.

### 🚀 The Solution

Rebel Remind brings clarity to the chaos. It **centralizes** student notifications into one clean, customizable hub — right inside the Chrome browser.

- 📚 **Canvas Integration** – Connects via API to fetch assignments, due dates, and announcements.
- 📅 **Campus Calendar Sync** – Uses web scraping to pull in official UNLV events and opportunities.
- 🔔 **Smart Notifications** – Choose between daily digests or weekly roundups based on your preference.
- ⚙️ **User Personalization** – Tailor what types of alerts you want and even create your own events.

### ✨ TL;DR

> Rebel Remind is your one-stop shop for staying **organized**, **on time**, and **in the loop** as a UNLV student. No more missed deadlines. No more scattered updates. Just one simple, powerful tool to keep you connected.

## Remind, Rebel, Repeat. 💪
